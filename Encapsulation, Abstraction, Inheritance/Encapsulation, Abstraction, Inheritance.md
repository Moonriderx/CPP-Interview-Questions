Encapsulation is a concept in Object-Oriented Programming which is responsible for the wrapping up of data under a single unit. 
Encapsulation restrict the direct access of some components for a security/integrity reasons
It hides the values or state of a structured data object inside a **class** . That way the clients cannot directly access to the data, which could expose hidden implementation details.



Abstraction reduces the complexity of the code by hiding the internal implementation. It displays only the required details. In the example provded in this code, we have GetSpeed() function
in our CPP file. In the main class, we only want to know what is the speed of the player, and not how the speed is calculated.


Inheritance is a principle where one class inherits the properties of another class. In our case we have class "Player" and from this class we can derive to "Human" for example or "Animal"
since the animal can be playable character too in our example. The derived class will inherit the main class properties like functions and variables.
